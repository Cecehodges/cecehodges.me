My name is Ceara and I am currently working towards obtaining a career in I.T. In my life I have worked as an aviculturist, working with multiple species of birds including penguins and macaws. After doing that for about four years, I attended nursing school at the UT Health Science Center San Antonio, now known as UT Health, where I obtained my BSN and shortly after my RN license. Three years later I realized I wasnâ€™t happy and wanted a change. This is where my journey to IT begins.

At the end of June 2019, I began studying for the CompTIA Network+. In September 2019, I attended the Open Cloud Academy bootcamp to further my knowledge and skills for this career change. After the OCA and with lots of help from online resources and my wonderful boyfriend, I passed my AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification.
