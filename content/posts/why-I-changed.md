### Why did I leave Nursing? ###

This is a question I have been asked *a lot.* And it's a question I have asked myself many, many times. The short of it is, is that I wasn't **happy.** 

I do believe I was good at my job, I put in a lot of hard work for my patients and coworkers. I received recognition from my managers and directors on how well I was doing and from patients and their families for providing them wonderful care. One director told me if she had ten nurses just like me, that her floor would run perfectly. But sleepless nights the evening before my shifts and the anxiety and depression that built up over the 2.5+ years I spent working as an RN added up. 

I tried in hospital nursing and out of hospital nursing. Medicine acute/step down, to home health, back to an acute setting with acute rehab. None it *"clicked."* None of it felt like my *"niche."* These were words I heard frequently from friends, family, and coworkers as encouragement to "find my place." But looking to the future, I couldn't imagine myself doing this type of job for another year, let alone the rest of my life. I needed a change.

After a wonderful vacation down to South Padre in the summer of 2019 I was definitely feeling those post vacation blues, but looking back it wasn't just the blues. I was **depressed** and did not enjoy going into work every day. I wanted to call out constantly, even when people whom I adored were working that day. I didn't want to do anything on my off days but lay around. I had a hard time sticking to personal goals I set for myself and I was constantly looking at nursing jobs, hoping one of them would *be the one* for me. I had a small break down after a particularly bad shift and felt like I couldn't do this anymore. I was unhappy and it affected my relationships around me. Was the job the sole reason for it? Maybe not, but it was a large contributer. It was my mother (also a nurse) who finally asked me, "Are you happy being a nurse? I don't think you are." After a long, hard look at myself and talks with loved ones, I knew what I had to do. I needed a job with a better work/life balance and that had room for me to grow and develop. To be able to obtain new and challenging roles and projects. This is where IT came in. 

### The Switch ###

As I may have mentioned before, my boyfriend currently works in IT. He went to the Open Cloud Academy over 5 years ago and has been very successful in his career since. He has also been incredibly supportive in my decisions to try to find a job/career that will make me happy; whether it was looking at grad school, finding another job, or changing careers altogether. With his help and support I was able to attend the Open Cloud Academy (OCA) myself and I do strongly believe that it was because of him I was able to be as successful as I was. 

I started studying for the Network+ certification on my own and with the help of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/networkplus/) in the summer of 2019, and in August of 2019 I passed the test. I entered the OCA in September of the same year. Unfortunately during the OCA I experienced the worst medical crisis of my life, resulting in a 4 day ICU stay. That story is for another day, another post. But I was still successful in the OCA, obtaining my Red Hat Certified System Administrator certification. I knew I wasn't done those because in this exciting new field I wanted to stand out a little bit as a newcomer. So I went on to get my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Cert about a month after the OCA, in January of 2020. 

At this point of writing this post I am continuing to apply to multiple jobs in search for my first tech job. I knew that the first job would most likely start off at a lower pay than my previous career, but I'm willing to take this risk because the reward of improving my mental health is priceless and I do think I can find the balance I'm looking for, where ever this path may take me.
